     * Updates properties on this node,

     * The properties array uses the propertyName in clark-notation as key,
     * and the array value for the property value. In the case a property
     * should be deleted, the property value will be null.
     *
     * This method must be atomic. If one property cannot be changed, the
     * entire operation must fail.
     *
     * If the operation was successful, true can be returned.
     * If the operation failed, false can be returned.
     *
     * Deletion of a non-existant property is always succesful.
     *
     * Lastly, it is optional to return detailed information about any
     * failures. In this case an array should be returned with the following
     * structure:
     *
     * array(
     *   403 => array(
     *      '{DAV:}displayname' => null,
     *   ),

     *      '{DAV:}owner' => null,
     *   )
     * )
     *
     * In this example it was forbidden to update {DAV:}displayname. 
     * (403 Forbidden), which in turn also caused {DAV:}owner to fail
     * (424 Failed Dependency) because the request needs to be atomic.
     *
     * @param array $mutations 
     * @return bool|array
